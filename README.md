# Neural Network Project
Multilayer perceptron implementation of a neural network for identifying hand drawn images, specifically numbers from the MNIST data set.

## Build
1. Download source code.
2. Download the MNIST data set including the training images and labels
3. Edit the source code to include the paths to where the MNIST data is.
4. Compile and run.
